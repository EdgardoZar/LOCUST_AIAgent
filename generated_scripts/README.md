# Generated Scripts

This directory contains Locust test scripts generated by the Jenkins Script Generation Pipeline.

## Purpose

- **Source**: Scripts are generated from JSON scenario configurations
- **Storage**: Scripts are committed to the `generated-scripts` Git branch
- **Usage**: These scripts can be used by the Test Execution Pipeline

## File Naming Convention

Scripts are named based on the scenario name from the JSON configuration:
- Spaces are replaced with underscores
- Special characters are removed
- Example: `Rick and Morty API Test` â†’ `Rick_and_Morty_API_Test.py`

## Workflow

1. **Generation**: Jenkins pipeline generates scripts from JSON scenarios
2. **Storage**: Scripts are copied here and committed to Git
3. **Execution**: Test Execution Pipeline can use these scripts for running tests

## Branch

These scripts are stored in the `generated-scripts` branch to keep them separate from the main codebase while still being version controlled.

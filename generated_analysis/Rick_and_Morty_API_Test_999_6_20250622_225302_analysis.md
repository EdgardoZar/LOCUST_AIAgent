| 95th Percentile | 170.00 ms |

### 💡 Key Insights
- The system was able to handle 10 concurrent users without any failures.
- The average response time was relatively high, indicating that some requests took significantly longer than others.
- The 90th and 95th percentile response times were significantly lower than the average, indicating that most requests were handled quickly.

### 🛠️ Recommendations
- Investigate the cause of the high average response time. This could be due to a few slow requests skewing the average.
- Consider running the test with more concurrent users to see how the system performs under heavier load.

### 🚨 Potential Issues & Concerns
- High average response time could indicate potential performance issues under heavier load.

### 💼 Business Impact
The high average response time could lead to a poor user experience, especially if the system is expected to handle more than 10 concurrent users in a real-world scenario. However, the fact that most requests were handled quickly (as indicated by the 90th and 95th percentile response times) is a positive sign.

### 🚀 Next Steps
- Investigate the cause of the high average response time.
- Run the test with more concurrent users.

|---|---|
| Average Response Time | 563.71 ms |
| 90th Percentile | 300.00 ms |
| 95th Percentile | 330.00 ms |

### Key Insights
- The test had a high request rate of 194.58 requests per second.
- The average response time of 563.71 ms indicates decent performance.
- The 90th percentile response time of 300.00 ms and 95th percentile of 330.00 ms show good consistency in response times.

### Recommendations
- Investigate and address the root cause of the one failed request to improve test reliability.
- Consider increasing the number of concurrent users to simulate higher loads and identify potential performance bottlenecks.
- Monitor the system under different scenarios to ensure consistent performance across varying loads.

### Potential Issues & Concerns
- One failed request may indicate a potential issue in the system's stability or reliability under load.

### Business Impact
The performance results indicate a good user experience under the current load conditions, but addressing the failed request and further optimizing response times can enhance overall system reliability and user satisfaction.

### Next Steps
- Investigate the cause of the failed request and implement necessary fixes.
- Perform additional load tests with varying user loads to validate system performance scalability.
- Continuously monitor and optimize response times to maintain a high level of performance.
